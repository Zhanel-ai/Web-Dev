    <h1>Button Demo</h1>

    <p>
        Here's the code:
        <code>&lt;button&gt;a button!&lt;/button&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        And here's the button:
        <button>a button!</button>
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice that the button doesn't do anything.
        You'll learn how to make buttons perform actions later on!
