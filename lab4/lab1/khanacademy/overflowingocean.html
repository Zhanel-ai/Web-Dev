                The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. 
                The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. 
                Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—
                dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s.

                Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea 
                (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7).
