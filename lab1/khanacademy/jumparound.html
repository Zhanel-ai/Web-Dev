            The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
            (macropods, meaning "large foot").
        </p>

        <p>
            Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping,
            a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head.
        </p>

        <p>
            Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing.
